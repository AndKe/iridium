Firmware:
========

 - the air modem is best programmed with iridium_air.hex which has firmware to automatically answer calls.
 - when also using iridium as ground modem, the board is best flashed with transparent firmware iridium_ground.hex. Use the python tool from the [tools](../tools) folder to dial.
